## Join us for Hacktoberfest 2023!

TL;DR: Learn WireMock and contribute to open source

Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software which happens as a global online hackathon.
As the official website states, “Hacktoberfest has grown from 676 participants in 2014 to nearly 147,000 participants last year”,
and it is surely the most massive open source hackathon.
The 2023 edition is presented by DigitalOcean, ILLA Cloud, and AppWrite.

This October the WireMock project will join the 10th edition of this worldwide event!
Regardless of their experience and background, everyone can support open source by contributing changes.
All contributors will receive special digital awards.
In WireMock, we are also happy to offer special swag to the most active contributors to the WireMock open source ecosyste
