This directory contains notes for different project and community infrastructure bits.

## Projects

- [GitHub](./github.md) - `@wiremock` GitHub org
- [Maven Central](./maven-central.md)
- [NPM](./npm.md) - we have a `~wiremock` organization there
- PyPi - a shared [@wiremock](https://pypi.org/user/wiremock/) user that is used for release automation
  and that owns official Python packages.

## Getting Support
