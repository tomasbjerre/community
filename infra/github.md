## WireMock organization on GitHub

[https://github.com/wiremock](https://github.com/wiremock) is our official organization on GitHub.
We host all the key repositories there,
and we use [.github](https://github.com/wiremock/.github) for organization-wide settings
and configuration templates.

Owner: WireMock Inc. Most of the engineering team members are admins there.
For community support, access, etc. please use the community Slack.

## External resources

There are plenty of GitHub repositories related to WireMock which
are hosted outside our official GitHub organization.
Normally we have no access to those repositories,
and cannot help with administration there.
Normally we recommend [transferring such repositories](https://github.com/wiremock/ecosystem/issues/new?assignees=&labels=hosting&projects=&template=1_hosting.yml) 
to the official GitHub org.

In some cases forking might happen if the repo is stale and the maintainer is not reachable.
